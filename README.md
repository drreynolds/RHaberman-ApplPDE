# MATLAB codes from Applied Partial Differential Equations by Richard Haberman

The figures for the fifth edition (2013) of Richard Haberman's text *Applied Partial Differential Equations (with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems)* published by Pearson were prepared using MATLAB 4.2. Please feel free to copy (download) any or all of these MATLAB m-files.

For examples, F234.M is the MATLAB m file for Figure 2.3.4. and F1244.M is for Figure 12.4.4.</DT>
