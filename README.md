# MATLAB codes from Applied Partial Differential Equations by Richard Haberman

The figures for the fifth edition (2013) of Richard Haberman's text *Applied Partial Differential Equations (with Fourier Series and Boundary Value Problems)* published by Pearson were prepared using MATLAB 4.2.

For examples, F234.M is the MATLAB m file for Figure 2.3.4. and F1244.M is for Figure 12.4.4.  These have been organized into folders for each chapter.

These codes had been posted on Richard Haberman's faculty web page at `SMU's Mathematics department <https://www.smu.edu/math>`_.  However, after his passing, we have archived these codes here on GitHub.
